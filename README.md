# Global Chat Suite

Global Chat Suite is a lightweight, peer-to-peer chat and file-sharing tool designed with privacy and simplicity in mind. It lets you connect directly with friends or colleagues over TCP, exchanging messages and files without relying on any central servers — all wrapped in fake traffic to help keep your communication discreet.

## Why Use Global Chat Suite?

- **Direct connection:** Chat and share files directly with your contacts, no middlemen or servers involved.
- **Obfuscated messages:** Chats are wrapped to look like normal HTTP traffic, helping avoid detection or censorship.
- **File sharing made easy:** Send files as encoded messages — no complicated setups required.
- **Remote Python commands:** For advanced users, you can execute or evaluate Python code remotely within the app.
- **Manage contacts:** Easily add, remove, and list trusted peers from the interface.
- **Lightweight & flexible:** Minimal dependencies, runs anywhere Python runs.

1. Run the script on your machine.

3. Chat in real time, send files, or execute remote Python commands.
4. Optionally, customize fake domain headers to tweak your traffic disguise.
